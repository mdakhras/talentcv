backend/app.py (key points)

Load .env.

On startup, parse data/cv.md, build embeddings, and keep an in-memory FAISS-like index (you can emulate with sklearn cosine similarity).

Implement endpoints described above.

CrewAI: create agents and tasks in crew/agents.py & crew/tasks.py; tools in crew/tools.py call the retriever.

Suggested questions per section (backend)

Provide a small dictionary of 5–8 questions per section (e.g., “Experience”: “What impact did you deliver at IOM?”, “How did you apply DevOps practices?” etc.). Return these from /api/questions.

Frontend details (React Native Web + Vite)

Use react-native, react-native-web, react-native-paper (material components w/ dark mode), and @tanstack/react-query.

Light/Dark mode: toggle in header; persist in localStorage.

Layout

Header: title, theme toggle.

Main grid: left—scrollable Section Cards (one per CV section) with “Ask this” question chips; right—Chat panel showing conversation and a text input with “Ask” button.

API client in src/lib/api.ts for the Flask routes.

TypeScript throughout.

frontend/package.json (essential deps)

  "name": "cv-chatbot-rnweb",
  "private": true,
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",

    "preview": "vite preview"
  },

    "@types/react-dom": "^18.3.0",
    "typescript": "^5.5.4",
    "vite": "^5.4.2"
  }
}

Frontend UX rules

Card for each section: title, short excerpt, list of question chips → clicking a chip posts to /api/ask with section.

Chat bubbles: user vs assistant, last message streaming (optional). Show Citations: Section, Subsection under assistant messages.

Keep spacing generous, shadows soft, rounded corners; no heavy colors.

README tasks (what to implement)

Backend

Implement loader.py to parse and normalize headings from data/cv.md.

Implement retriever.py with embedding index and search(query, section?).

Implement agents.py (Router, RAG, Refiner) using CrewAI; inject retrieved context into prompts.

Implement tasks.py composing the agents.

Implement app.py with Flask routes, CORS, and error handling.

Frontend

Configure react-native-web with Vite; add App.tsx grid layout (cards left, chat right).

Build SectionCard.tsx, QuestionList.tsx, Chat.tsx, Header.tsx.

Theme provider with dark/light support; toggle in header.

Data fetching via React Query; optimistic UI when sending a question.

Env & Run

Copy backend/.env.example → backend/.env and fill Azure OpenAI values.

Dev commands: run backend on :8000, frontend on :5173.

Ensure CORS allows the frontend origin.

Quality bar / Acceptance criteria

App loads sections from /api/sections.

Clicking any suggested question yields an answer within 2–5s and shows citations.

Free-form questions work and remain grounded; if info not in CV, politely respond “Not found in CV.”

Light/dark mode persists.

No PII leaks beyond what’s in cv.md. No tool calls outside RAG.

Sample data/cv.md

Use exactly this content in backend/data/cv.md (keep headings and spacing):

Dev commands

Backend: cd backend && python app.py (or flask run --port 8000)

Frontend: cd frontend && npm i && npm run dev

The app should run with frontend at http://localhost:5173 talking to backend http://localhost:8000.

Testing checklist

 /api/sections returns all top-level sections from cv.md.

 Clicking a suggested question posts to /api/ask and returns an answer with citations.

 Free-form user input works; when info isn’t present in cv.md, the bot says it can’t find it and suggests the nearest section.

 Light/dark toggle persists.

 CrewAI chain runs without blocking the server, with clear logs.

Please generate all necessary code files and comments inline so I can run immediately on Replit.
